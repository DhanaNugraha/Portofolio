*"Create a visually striking personal portfolio website for a Backend Software Engineer who also does some frontend. The site should feel modern, unique, and professional, with smooth interactions and animations. It should NOT look like a typical template.

Features & Sections:

Landing Page:

Bold hero section with name (“D N”) and tagline like “Building scalable APIs & reliable systems.”

Subtle animated background (e.g., gradient shift, particle effect, or geometric pattern).

Call-to-action buttons linking to Projects and Contact.

About Me:

Storytelling style: describe backend expertise (Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, deployment on cloud services).

Highlight collaboration skills and willingness to do frontend when needed.

Include a timeline or milestone visualization (education, career, major projects).

Projects Showcase:

Each project card should be interactive (hover animations, flip/reveal effects).

Show project title, description, tech stack, outcomes/impact, and links.

Categorization filter (e.g., “Backend APIs”, “Fullstack”, “Personal Tools”).

Tech Stack Section:

Icon grid of core tools & languages (Python, Flask, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, React, etc.).

Animated badges or progress indicators to show strengths.

Contact Section:

Clean contact form with validation.

Direct links to email, GitHub, and LinkedIn with modern social icons.

Design Style:

Dark + light mode toggle.

Sleek typography (large bold headings, clean body text).

Minimalist but not plain: use motion, asymmetrical layouts, and micro-animations.

Mobile-first, fully responsive.

Tech for Website:

Build with React + Tailwind CSS.

Use Framer Motion for animations.

Grid-based layouts for clarity.

Optimized for deployment (Vercel/Netlify).

The goal: A one-of-a-kind portfolio that feels crafted, polished, and interactive — not a basic resume site."*
