About Me
I am a determined and responsible professional with a strong adaptive mindset, actively pursuing a career as an software engineer. During my previous experience as a Technology and Engineering intern at PT Pertamina Power Indonesia, I worked on critical projects focused on sustainable energy solutions, including simulating alternative power sources and creating a techno-economic analysis of new technologies. This experience helped me build strong problem-solving and analytical skills. Through a software engineering bootcamp, I built a RESTful API for an eco-friendly marketplace using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL, achieving 98% test coverage. With strong technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, and a commitment to growth, I’m eager to contribute my abilities to drive impactful solutions in collaborative environments.
